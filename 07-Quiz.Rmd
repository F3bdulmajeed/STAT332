# Quick Quiz {-}

**Problem **
\
You will use the iris dataset that comes with R by default.  You can access this dataset simply by typing in `iris` in your R console. More information about the dataset is given here `help(iris)`. You will find that it consists of 150 observations(rows) and 5 variables (columns), here we will only be interested in the petal length and petal width
```{r}
head(iris)
```

We aim here to predict the petal width given the petal length using simple linear regression so please answer the following question.
\
1. Comment about the scatter plot of the two variables. 
\
2. Write down the estimated line equation.
\
3. Test the existence of the regression using two approaches.
\
4. Use the function `hist()` to draw a histogram of the residuals and comment. 
\
5. Interpret the value of $R^2$
